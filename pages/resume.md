## experience

**[mu](https://github.com/cosmicoptima/mu)** (sep 2021 - present)

mu is an MPD client written in Haskell; its current features are basic, but it
will soon support a DSL for filters, sorts and other aspects of library
management.

mu uses [Scotty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty) as its web
framework and [libmpd](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/libmpd) to interface
with MPD; it will use Megaparsec for its parser.

**[birdwatch](https://github.com/cosmicoptima/birdwatch)** (june 2021)

birdwatch is a Python library designed to retrieve Twitter data at speeds faster
than those officially supported by the API. Currently its functionality mirrors
that of [snscrape](https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape)'s Twitter
module, although with much less code. Both birdwatch and snscrape are obstructed
by per-IP rate limits, which I'm not yet sure how to bypass.

**[this site](https://github.com/cosmicoptima/cosmicoptima.github.io)** (june 2021 - present)

I wrote this site's CSS in June; since then I haven't updated it much. I plan to
move from GitHub Pages soon, which will afford me a bit more control.

The design is intentionally minimalistic.

**[twitter hybrid experiment](https://twitter.com/parafactual/status/1381375742978703361)** (apr 2021)

I trained and used a
[Doc2Vec](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/doc2vec.html) model to tell
any Twitter users who inquired two other accounts they were a stylistic "hybrid"
of.
