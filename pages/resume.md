hi, i'm **celeste drummond**

## contact

**email:** parafactual {arobase} gmail.com  
**discord:** celeste#2692

## experience

### professional

not really

### personal

_(most of my work until very recently has not been public, which is why this_
_list is so sparse)_

**[mu](https://github.com/cosmicoptima/mu)** (sep 2021 - present)

This is an MPD client written in Haskell; its current features are basic, but it
will soon support a DSL for filters, sorts and other aspects of library
management. I am writing mu due to my dissatisfaction with existing MPD clients,
which aren't customizable or powerful enough.

mu uses [Scotty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty) as its web
framework and [libmpd](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/libmpd) to interface
with MPD; it will use Megaparsec for its parser.
