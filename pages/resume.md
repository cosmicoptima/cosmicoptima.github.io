## experience

### professional

not really

### personal

_(most of my work until very recently has not been public, which is why this_
_list is so sparse)_

**[mu](https://github.com/cosmicoptima/mu)** (sep 2021 - present)

mu is an MPD client written in Haskell; its current features are basic, but it
will soon support a DSL for filters, sorts and other aspects of library
management. I am writing mu due to my dissatisfaction with existing MPD clients,
which aren't customizable or powerful enough.

mu uses [Scotty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty) as its web
framework and [libmpd](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/libmpd) to interface
with MPD; it will use Megaparsec for its parser.

**[birdwatch](https://github.com/cosmicoptima/birdwatch)** (june 2021)

birdwatch is a Python library designed to retrieve Twitter data at speeds faster
than those officially supported by the API. Currently its functionality mirrors
that of [snscrape](https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape)'s Twitter
module, although with much less code. Both birdwatch and snscrape are obstructed
by per-IP rate limits, which I'm not yet sure how to bypass.
